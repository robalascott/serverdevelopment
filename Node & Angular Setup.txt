(Since i had problem getting it to work with tomcat in eclipse i installed a http-server):
Open CMD
Navigate to Project folder
Install server with: "npm install http-server -g"
Run server(must be from folder): "http-server -o --cors "
You should be able to navigate to localhost:8080 to se the content of the http-server
